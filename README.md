# Experiment Notebook - AutoAI Notebook v1.14.4
This notebook contains the steps and code to demonstrate support of AutoAI experiments in Watson Machine Learning service. It introduces Python SDK commands for data retrieval, training experiments, persisting pipelines, testing pipelines, refining pipelines, and scoring the resulting model.

Note: Notebook code generated using AutoAI will execute successfully. If code is modified or reordered, there is no guarantee it will successfully execute. For details, see: Saving an Auto AI experiment as a notebook

Some familiarity with Python is helpful. This notebook uses Python 3.7 and ibm_watson_machine_learning package.

# Notebook goals

The learning goals of this notebook are:

1. Defining an AutoAI experiment

2. Training AutoAI models

3. Comparing trained models

4. Deploying the model as a web service

5. Scoring the model to generate predictions.
